<h2 align="center">Logger++ API Filters List</h2>

Logger++ enhances the logging capabilities of Burp Suite by enabling advanced filters that highlight interesting entries or filter logs to those that match specific criteria. In this collection, we've curated a list of Logger++ filters for API requests and responses. Each filter is accompanied by a description of its purpose, making it easier for you to customize your Logger++ configuration for your API security testing and debugging needs.

## Table of Logger++ Filters

Here's a comprehensive list of Logger++ filters that you can use to monitor and analyze API interactions. Each filter is assigned a unique number, features a regular expression (regex) for matching criteria, and comes with a clear description of what it logs.
