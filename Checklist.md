### Improper Assets Management

- [ ] Test by changing the version in URL path (e.g., /api/v2/user to /api/v1/user)

- [ ] Test by changing the version in request parameters (e.g., /api/product?ver=2)

- [ ] Test by changing the version in request headers (e.g., Accept version=2.0)
		
### Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)

- [ ] Change path to access admin functionality (e.g., /user/10/delete to /admin/user/10/delete)

- [ ] Test MIME type validation bypass.

- [ ] Use Wildcard parameter (/user/*)

- [ ] Parameter pollution (id=1&id=2)

## GraphQL API

### Information Disclosure

- [ ] Test GraphQL introspection
  
- [ ] Find GraphiQL endpoint

- [ ] Test GraphQL interface protection bypass by changing the cookie value from env=graphiql:disable to env=graphiql:enable

- [ ] Bypass introspection by changing the content-type to URL-encoded introspection.

- [ ] Use InQL Scanner to find hidden queries.


### Denial of Service (DOS)

- [ ] Test nested queries.

- [ ] Test nested fragments.

- [ ] Test batching queries.

## REST And GraphQL

### Lack of Rate Limit

- [ ] Create an alias for the password field.

- [ ] Change the endpoint with different spellings.

- [ ] Changing IP In Request	Header
      
      X-Forwarded-For:127.0.0.1
      X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1

      X-Host: 127.0.0.1
      X-Forwarded-Host: 127.0.0.1
      use double X-Forwared-For header X-Forwarded-For: X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
      
### Error Handling

- [ ] Test error handling for field suggestions.

- [ ] Test error handling for internal paths.

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- [ ] Test SSRF by including full URLs in the POST body or parameters.
